            Hi, I am Harsh Sidhpuria, a passionate software developer with a
            solid computer engineering background. I have experience in
            full-stack development with C, C#, Python, JavaScript, and RESTful

            My projects include an intuitive campus navigation system and
            real-time emotion detection. With ASP.NET Core, advanced algorithms,
            and teamwork, I work towards the impact and efficiency of results.

            Besides coding, I love traveling, reading, and learning new
            technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech world.
